Bugger

I'm not sure if people can see the comment that I put when I submitted the project, so to log in use:

user: admin<br>
password: admin

Feel free to create a user account and any projects or bugs, as I'm going to rebuild the database when all this is finished.

I didn't add in a register option since if you were using this for real because, in most cases, you don't want public access to a large group project, and only want those working on the project giving input on fixes and their priority.
